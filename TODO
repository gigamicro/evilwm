## Intermediate tasks


RandR-based multi-monitor support has now been implemented, but it would be
nice if, when a client is moved due to removing a monitor, it could be moved
back to its original position if the _same_ monitor is reattached.  Whether a
monitor is the "same" is probably just down to whether it occupies the same
geometry on the screen.

eg
screen 100x200  window 1x1+98+198
screen 100x100  window 1x1+98+98
screen 200x100  window 1x1+98+98
screen 200x200  window 1x1+98+198

also!
screen 100x200  window 1x1+98+198
screen 100x200  window 100x100+100+0 (max)
screen 100x100  window 100x100 (max)
screen 100x100  window 1x1+98+198 -> wrong

^ also, offscreen windows - move so that only the nearest portion of the border is visible on next()?


what about making the list type something with trivial removal (iterators just skip null values) and append/prepend?
periodically reallocated array?
linkedlist with final null-null element?
linkedlist with pointers from data?
... 3x doubly linked list in struct client?

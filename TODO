ability to disable focus-keeping on root window?

rmb+- click+drag,click- -> move + resize?

func_spawn: configurable array of commands to run indexed by FL_VALUEMASK?

FL_boundary('bound'?)/limit('lim')/etc flag
FL_BOTTOM=FL_this|FL_DOWN
move,rel+(this)+left -> c.x = c.x - (c.bw*2? + c.width) etc

bind for dock visibility only while held
bind for other things while held?
key release binds

use getpointer for drag/sweep? wouldn't have to grab
but when would it poll lol

allow func_info bind to work on screens/rootwindow?
maybe add vdesk id

show info also makes the window disappear?
click-through?

some kind of bind to toggle mouse focus
or mouse existence at all
maybe trap mouse in current window unless alt is held?

mouse binds on root window

drag/drop target on root window?
(handle multiple-element)

generate helptext with options list, default values as calculated, and description list

figure out modvdesks incomplete cases eg num=8 mod=7,9,-1,6

bring forward/backward based on overlapping visible windows only

unmaximize windows to pointer (same logic as placement)

make alloc_window_array only trigger when there's actually not enough space

grab pointer on mask2 held; does this allow escaping game look binds?

generalize masks to any string
is there a standard string to kbstate function?
modifier for no modifier (on button binds), or option to disable autocorrect for it
--mask altmask=shift
linked list

make list.c use (struct list **list) to set the head

multithread?
actually, could just run the grabbing actions through some state (mask) and the regular event loop

read {/etc,$XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/{evilwm.conf, evilwm.conf.d}

## Intermediate tasks

what about making the list type something with trivial removal (iterators just skip null values) and append/prepend?
periodically reallocated array?
linkedlist with final null-null element?
linkedlist with pointers from data?
... 3x doubly linked list in struct client?

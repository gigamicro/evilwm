## Intermediate tasks


Investigate SHAPEd windows for client sweep/drag.  As it stands, non-solid
drags and all sweeps draw a border by inverting pixels on the screen, erasing
by re-inverting.  This requires the X server to be grabbed, which is
undesirable.

^ what if you froze the client window and resized our parent?
that doesn't work without a freeze, the non-border section just doesn't draw, and even then the undrawn portion would be mostly border


Although the current methods work well enough, it would be nice to not have to
grab the X server so often.  e.g., when adding or removing a client, maintain a
set of windows that the error handler should treat differently.


RandR-based multi-monitor support has now been implemented, but it would be
nice if, when a client is moved due to removing a monitor, it could be moved
back to its original position if the _same_ monitor is reattached.  Whether a
monitor is the "same" is probably just down to whether it occupies the same
geometry on the screen.

eg
screen 100x200  window 1x1+98+198
screen 100x100  window 1x1+98+98
screen 200x100  window 1x1+98+98
screen 200x200  window 1x1+98+198

also!
screen 100x200  window 1x1+98+198
screen 100x200  window 100x100+100+0 (max)
screen 100x100  window 100x100 (max)
screen 100x100  window 1x1+98+198 -> wrong

^ also, offscreen windows - move so that only the nearest portion of the border is visible on next()?
